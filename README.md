# cppfitpack

My C++ wrapper for [fitpack](https://www.netlib.org/fitpack/) with [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

Now support `parcur` and `splev` for B-spline fitting.

Tests are built under VS2019, with [Intel&copy; Fortran Compiler](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html)
